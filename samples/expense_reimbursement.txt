Expense Reimbursement and Travel Policy

Expense Submission
All business expenses must be submitted within 30 days of incurring the expense. Use the company expense management system to submit receipts and expense reports. Receipts are required for all expenses over $25. Expenses must be approved by your manager before reimbursement.

Approved Expenses
Business meals with clients or prospects are reimbursable up to $75 per person. Travel expenses including flights, hotels, and rental cars are covered when traveling for business purposes. Conference fees, training costs, and professional development expenses are reimbursable with prior approval. Office supplies and equipment purchases require manager approval.

Travel Policy
Employees should book travel through the company travel portal to ensure best rates and automatic expense tracking. Economy class flights are standard for domestic travel. Business class may be approved for international flights over 6 hours. Hotel accommodations should be booked at mid-range business hotels. Per diem rates apply for meals: $50 per day for domestic travel, $75 per day for international travel.

Reimbursement Timeline
Expense reports are typically processed within 5-7 business days after manager approval. Reimbursements are issued via direct deposit to the same account used for payroll. Employees will receive email notification when reimbursement is processed.

Non-Reimbursable Expenses
Personal expenses, alcohol (unless part of approved client entertainment), and expenses without receipts are not reimbursable. First-class travel, luxury hotels, and personal entertainment expenses are not covered. Expenses that violate company policy or are not business-related will be denied.
