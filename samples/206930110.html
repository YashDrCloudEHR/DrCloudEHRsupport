Select &quot;New Task&quot; to begin creating a task.</li><li>Choose the &quot;Additive&quot; option to create a new task.</li><li>In the subject field, you can either select from the dropdown options or type in your own subject. For example, you might enter &quot;Arranging trip details for a family trip Jazzy's taken with her spouse and kids.&quot;</li><li>Set a due date for the task. In this case, a due date of three weeks from the current date is appropriate.</li><li>Use the search function to find and add contacts related to the task. For instance, you can add Jazzy's spouse to the task.</li><li>Ensure that the task is related to the correct person. In this example, Jazzy is the individual whose chart is being updated.</li><li>Assign the task to yourself to indicate that you will be responsible for its completion.</li><li>Set the status of the task to &quot;In Progress&quot; if you have already begun working on it.</li><li>Save the task.
