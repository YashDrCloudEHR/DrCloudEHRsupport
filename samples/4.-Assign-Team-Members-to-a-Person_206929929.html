                    <p>In this guide, we will outline the process of adding members to a person's team</p><ol><li>From the Person's chart, navigate to the &quot;Person team&quot; section and select &quot;New.&quot;</li><li>Enter the effective date and time. This should default to the person's chart you are currently viewing, but it's always good to double-check.</li><li>Search for the members you wish to add. This will include staff that you have in your system.</li><li>If you search by name, for example, &quot;Shirley Robertson,&quot; select the appropriate person from the search results.</li><li>If the member you are adding is the primary team member or provider, be sure to select that box.</li><li>Choose the assigned facility for the person being added.</li><li>Click &quot;save&quot; to finalize the addition.</li></ol><p><strong>Note</strong>: If the person already has a primary team member, the system will not allow you to select another primary member.</p><p>After saving, you will see that the new member has been successfully added to the person's team. For instance, you may now have an RN and a DSP assigned to the team.</p><p>By following these steps, you can efficiently manage team assignments and ensure that all necessary personnel are included in a person's care team.</p>
