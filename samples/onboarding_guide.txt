New Employee Onboarding Guide

First Day Checklist
On your first day, you will receive your employee ID badge, laptop, and access credentials. You'll meet with HR to complete paperwork including tax forms, direct deposit setup, and benefits enrollment. A welcome orientation session will introduce you to company culture, values, and key policies.

First Week Activities
During your first week, you'll be assigned a buddy who will help you navigate the organization. You'll complete mandatory training modules covering safety, security, and company policies. Schedule meetings with your manager to discuss role expectations, team structure, and initial projects. Set up your workspace and familiarize yourself with company tools and systems.

Key Systems and Tools
All employees use Microsoft 365 for email, calendar, and collaboration. Project management is handled through Jira and Asana. Communication happens via Slack for team chat and Microsoft Teams for video meetings. Time tracking is done through our HRIS system accessible via the employee portal.

Getting Help
Your direct manager is your primary point of contact for role-specific questions. HR handles benefits, payroll, and policy questions. IT support is available via helpdesk@company.com or extension 5555. For urgent IT issues, contact the IT emergency line at extension 5556.

30-Day Review
After 30 days, you'll have a check-in meeting with your manager to discuss your progress, address any questions, and set goals for the next 60 days. This is also an opportunity to provide feedback on the onboarding process.
