                    <p>This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough of scheduling a new event, selecting specializations, and ensuring all necessary details are documented accurately.</p><ol><li>Scheduling a New Event<ol><li>To begin scheduling a new event, navigate to the home page and select the &quot;New Event&quot; option. This action allows you to choose between a clinical appointment or a service appointment, depending on the nature of the visit.</li></ol></li><li>Selecting Specializations and Physicians<ol><li>Once the new event pop-up box appears, you can select the appropriate specialization. For instance, if the appointment requires a neurologist, you can choose this specialization from the list. This selection narrows down the available physicians or specialists, displaying only those related to neurology.</li></ol></li><li>Choosing the Person<ol><li>Next, select the person for whom the appointment is being scheduled. The system will provide a list of all individuals assigned to you based on the chosen specialization. After selecting the person, you will see the relevant physicians or specialists listed under neurology.</li></ol></li><li>Choosing the Clinic and Providing Details<ol><li>After selecting the specialist, you can choose the clinic to which you are sending the patient. If the desired clinic is listed, enter the necessary details, such as the subject of the appointment, in the subject box.</li></ol></li><li>Setting the Date and Time<ol><li>Set the start date and time for the appointment. For example, if you are scheduling the appointment for next Tuesday at 2:00 p.m., the system will default to a one-hour duration, which can be adjusted as needed.</li></ol></li><li>Assigning Attendees and Status<ol><li>As the primary attendee, you can also assign additional staff members to accompany you to the appointment. The status of the appointment will be marked as &quot;Scheduled&quot; until the appointment occurs. You can specify the type of appointment, such as a follow-up or initial consultation, and include detailed information regarding the reason for the visit.</li></ol></li><li>Adding Contacts and Finalizing the Appointment<ol><li>To ensure all relevant parties are informed, you can add contacts to the appointment. Once all details are entered, save the appointment.</li></ol></li><li>Managing the Appointment on the Calendar<ol><li>To review the appointment, go to your calendar and scroll to the scheduled date. Select the appointment and choose &quot;More Details&quot; to view additional information. If necessary, you can print out the medical consultation form, which includes the reason for the visit and healthcare concerns. This form should be taken to the appointment for the physician to fill out and sign.</li></ol></li><li>Post-Appointment Documentation<ol><li>After returning from the appointment, file the completed and signed medical consultation form in the patient's chart. This can be done by uploading the document to the file repository within the patient's chart, ensuring that all records are accurately maintained.</li></ol></li></ol><p>By following these steps, healthcare providers can efficiently schedule and manage clinical appointments, ensuring that all necessary details are documented and accessible for optimal patient care.</p>
